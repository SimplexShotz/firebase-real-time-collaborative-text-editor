# firebase-real-time-collaborative-text-editor
This is a real time, collaborative text editor I created myself from scratch; it utilizes nothing but Firebase!

To try the live demo, check out https://simplexshotz.github.io/firebase-real-time-collaborative-text-editor/

All code is free to use.

The editor supports:
 - Theoretically Infinite Users (the free Firebase plan is limited to 100 simeltaneous connections, however)
 - Typing / Deleting (even while selecting text)
 - Cutting / Pasting
 - Line Breaks
 - Adding Styles (including bold, italic, underline, and strikethrough)
 - Smart Syncing (clients will almost always be viewing the exact same text)
 - Links
 - Custom Undo/Redo Stack
 - Activity Status

Coming Soon:
 - Realtime Cursors
 - Ctrl + Backspace/Delete Support
 - Full Support for Multiple Vertexes (text fields)
