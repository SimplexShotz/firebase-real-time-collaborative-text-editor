# firebase-real-time-collaborative-text-editor
This is a real time, collaborative text editor I created myself from scratch; it utilizes nothing but Firebase!

To try the live demo, check out https://simplexshotz.github.io/firebase-real-time-collaborative-text-editor/

All code is free to use.

The editor supports:
 - Infinite Simultaneously Connected Users
 - Typing, Deleting, Copying, Cutting, Pasting, Inserting Text, etc.
 - Adding Styles (including bold, italic, underline, and strikethrough)
 - Smart Syncing (clients will almost always be viewing the exact same text)
 - Links
 - Custom Global Undo/Redo Stack
 - Activity Status
 - Realtime Cursors
